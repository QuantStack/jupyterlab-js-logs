JupyterLab extension to show the console logs from the browser dev tools console.

## Requirements

- JupyterLab >= 2.0

## Motivation

The main purpose for this extension is to provide a way to surface the console logs from the browser dev tools console in the JupyterLab interface.
Especially for users that are not familiar with the browser dev tools, this extension can be very useful to debug and understand the logs generated by the JavaScript code running in the browser.

## Install

```bash
jupyter labextension install jupyterlab-js-logs
```

## Contributing

This extension was bootstrapped from the [custom-log-console](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples/tree/master/custom-log-console) example contributed by [Carlos Herrero](https://github.com/hbcarlos), from the [`jupyterlab-extension-examples`](https://github.com/jupyterlab/extension-examples) repository.

### Install

The `jlpm` command is JupyterLab's pinned version of
[yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) that is installed with JupyterLab. You may use
`yarn` or `npm` in lieu of `jlpm` below.

```bash
# Clone the repo to your local environment
# Move to jupyterlab-js-logs directory

# Install dependencies
jlpm
# Build Typescript source
jlpm build
# Link your development version of the extension with JupyterLab
jupyter labextension install .
# Rebuild Typescript source after making changes
jlpm build
# Rebuild JupyterLab after making any changes
jupyter lab build
```

You can watch the source directory and run JupyterLab in watch mode to watch for changes in the extension's source and automatically rebuild the extension and application.

```bash
# Watch the source directory in another terminal tab
jlpm watch
# Run jupyterlab in watch mode in one terminal tab
jupyter lab --watch
```

Now every change will be built locally and bundled into JupyterLab. Be sure to refresh your browser page after saving file changes to reload the extension (note: you'll need to wait for webpack to finish, which can take 10s+ at times).

### Uninstall

```bash

jupyter labextension uninstall jupyterlab-js-logs
```
